        - Fixed <rdar://problem/4392583> REGRESSION: Reproducible crash while viewing Opera's "why we're better than Safari" site, http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html, in khtml::RenderBlock::nodeAtPoint

        Fix by Darin, reviewed and landed by me.

        * khtml/rendering/render_container.cpp:
        (RenderContainer::updatePseudoChild): Don't have the parent call removeChild, because the child calls parent()->removeChild() on itself in detach().
