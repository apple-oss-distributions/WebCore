            On a large page with a wheel event handler on the body, we would call
            Element::absoluteEventHandlerBounds() for every element under the body,
            and compute an absolute bounds for each one. This is very slow.

            For now, optimize computing a region for the <body> by just using the document
            bounds, which will always be as big or larger. It's OK for this region to
            be an overestimate.

            Since the tree scope is set to that of Document's inside removeBetween when a node is removed from a shadow tree,

            Crash when font completes downloading after calling 2D canvas setText() multiple times
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148789

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The CSSFontSelector has a list of clients, and when fonts complete downloading, these
            clients get a call back. CanvasRenderingContext2D::State is one such of these clients. However,
            the CSSFontSelector may be destroyed and recreated at any time. We were getting into a case
            where multiple CSSFontSelectors were thinking that the same CanvasRenderingContext2D::State were
            their client. When the CanvasRenderingContext2D::State was destroyed, it only unregistered
            itself from one of the CSSFontSelectors, which means the CSSFontSelector left over has a dangling
            pointer to it.

            The solution is to implement a new helper class, FontProxy, to hold the
            CanvasRenderingContext2D::State's font, and maintain the invariant that this object is always
            registered to exactly one CSSFontSelector, and this CSSFontSelector is the one which is associated
            with the FontProxy's FontCascade object. This patch maintains this invariant, as well as protecting
            all access to the State's FontCascade object so no one can reach in and change it without going
            through functions which maintain the invariant.

            The "Charset Index" in OTF are indices into a collection of strings. There are
            390 predefined strings in this collection. We were currently assigning each
            glyph to one of these strings. However, if there are more glyphs than strings,
            we will be using invalid indices.

            The values of the strings themselves are not necessary for SVG fonts. Therefore,
            the solution is to create a single dummy string, and have all glyphs target it.

            [Content Filtering] Determine navigation and content policy before continuing to filter a load
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148506

            Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

            Prior to this change, ContentFilter would hide from DocumentLoader all CachedRawResourceClient callbacks until
            a decision was made, then replay the missed callbacks. This approach interacted poorly with some features of
            the loader, notably appcache and downloads. In the case of appcache, DocumentLoader might not have a chance to
            check for substitute data until the original load has finished, wasting bandwidth, and might receive duplicate
            or out-of-order callbacks. In the case of downloads, it would often be too late to convert the existing
            connection to a download, leading to restarted downloads or outright failures.

            Bandaids were put in place for these issues in r188150, r188486, and r188851 to fix crashes or serious
            regressions in behavior, but these weren't complete fixes. They did not solve any of the duplicate data loading
            problems, and they did not make downloads work reliably in all cases.

            This patch rolls out the bandaids (but keeps their tests) and replaces them with a more robust fix. Instead of
            hiding callbacks from DocumentLoader, ContentFilter now delivers willSendRequest(), redirectReceived(), and
            responseReceived() to DocumentLoader immediately, and cancels filtering if DocumentLoader decides to ignore the
            load, download it, or load substitute data. ContentFilter continues to buffer incoming data to prevent partial
            rendering of blocked content.

            The existing tests for r188150 and r188851 were kept, the test for r188486 was rewritten to be specific to
            content filtering, and new tests were added to cover the case where ContentFilter is still undecided after a
            load finishes.

            Some Websites (e.g. www.popehat.com) also wrongly return Epoch as

            [Cocoa] Punctuation near Hindi text is garbled when styled with the system font
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148164

            Reviewed by Brian Burg.

            Fonts cache whether or not they are the system font. This caching took place at the end of Font::platformInit().
            However, in the middle of Font::platformInit(), we look up a glyph, which calls GlyphPage::fill() which consults
            with this cache. However, at this point, the cache has not been constructed yet. The solution is just to
            construct the cache earlier (at the beginning of the function).

            Consulting with the cache before it is populated causes it to erroneously say that no fonts are system fonts.
            Then, we use Core Graphics to ask for glyphs instead of Core Text. Core Graphics, however, is incapable of
            handling the system font, and returns us garbled results. In particular, when the system language is set to
            Japanese, the system font does not support punctuation, and Core Text tells us so. However, Core Graphics
            erroneously tells us that the system font does support punctuation.

            Then, if text is near the punctuation which causes us to take the complex text codepath (such as Hindi text),
            we tell Core Text to explicitly lay out the punctuation using the system font (which does not support
            punctuation). Core Text then replies that the provided font doesn't support the punctuation, and that we should
            use LastResort with some other glyphs instead. WebKit then disregards the font CoreText told us to use (because
            we are oh-so-sure that the font in question supports punctuation) and uses the LastResort glyph IDs with our
            font, which causes arbitrary glyphs to be shown.

            We cache the current viewport renderer (FrameView::m_viewportRenderer) right before layout.
            It gets dereferenced later when layout is finished to update the overflow status.
            If the viewport renderer gets destroyed during layout, we end up with a dangling pointer.
            This patch replaces the pointer caching with type caching (none, body, document).

            A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
            RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
            However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
            end up going across selection roots.
            This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.

            When two seekWithTolerance() requests come in before the first is acted upon in seekTask(),
            the second will result in a "no seek required" conditional, because the new "currentTime" is

            When cancelling a pending seek, first replace the "now" value with the "now" value from the

            Applying CSS display styles to tables can end up inserting anonymous RenderTableRows, which is not handled well by the

            and finding the real rows and cells we want. In addition, another thing also causing malformed tables is that "grid"

            In order to perform font fallback, we must know which fonts support which characters. We
            perform this check by asking each font to map a sequence of codepoints to glyphs, and
            any glyphs which end up with a 0 value are unsupported by the font.

            One of the mechanisms that we use to do this is to combine the code points into a string,
            and tell Core Text to lay out the string. However, this is fundamentally a different
            operation than the one we are trying to perform. Strings combine adjacent codepoints into
            grapheme clusters, and CoreText operates on these. However, we are trying to gain
            information regarding codepoints, not grapheme clusters.

            Instead of taking this string-based approach, we should try harder to use Core Text
            functions which operate on ordered collections of characters, rather than strings. In
            particular, CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters() and CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters()
            have the behavior we want where any unmapped characters end up with a 0 value glyph.

            Previously, we were only using the result of those functions if they were successfully
            able to map their entire input. However, given the fact that we can degrade gracefully
            in the case of a partial mapping, we shouldn't need to bail completely to the
            string-based approach should a partial mapping occur.

            At some point we should delete the string-based approach entirely. However, this path
            is still explicitly used for composite fonts. Fixing that use case is out of scope
            for this patch.

            When we are wrapping up processing of the wheel event for a given frame, if the current latching context
            does NOT apply to the current frame (e.g., because it's latched to an enclosing frame) we should not pass
            wheel events directly to the latched elements scrollable container. Instead, we should just give the current
            frame an opportunity to perform any custom wheel event handling and return, so that the enclosing (latched)
            frame can do the rest of its event handling.

            If we don't do this, we incorrectly ask the enclosing frame to process the event, then return claiming that
            we handled the event, preventing the enclosing frame from doing its part of the processing.

            When an accelerated animation or transition was started at the same time as
            a non-accelerated one, and then the node for the former was removed, we could
            never kick off the non-accelerated animation.

            AnimationControllerPrivate has logic to synchronize the two types of animation
            when they start in the same animation update, which involves setting the
            m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag, and waiting for a notifyAnimationStarted()
            to come in from the graphics system.

            However, it failed to handle the case where the accelerated animation was removed
            before the callback was received, which left the m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag
            set to true, preventing the non-accelerated animation from running.

            [iOS] Crash when encountering characters whose natural font is one we can't look up

            These characters hit the complex text code path, where CoreText picks fonts
            to use for each character. We then try to map these CoreText fonts back to
            our own Font objects, and we assume (on iOS) that our own font search will
            always return something.

            On OS X, we do not have such an assumption, and we handle the case where it
            does not hold. This method works on iOS as well, so the solution is to just
            perform it on both OSes.

            Blurry inline video controls are the result of transform scaling up the content when the page
            is zoomed out (page scale > 1).
            This patch addresses the blurriness by switching to css zoom when the content is being scaled up.
            While transform scale is a paint time operation, css zoom triggers layout and the content is getting
            painted on a non-scaled graphics context.

            Overlap testing for compositing uses the currently laid out position of fixed
            elements, without taking into account the fact that async scrolling can move
            them around, and possibly under other non-composited elements. This manifested
            as position:fixed elements moving over other elements on some pages when
            scrolling, when they should have moved behind.

            Fix by expanding the overlap map entry for position:fixed elements to create
            an rect for the area they cover at all scroll locations, taking min and max
            scroll offsets into account.

            Also add a couple more LOG(Compositing) statements.

            When rules with too many selectors were added, the index would overflow and
            some RuleData would point to selectors in the middle of selector chains. The resulting
            behavior is random based on the selectors and the DOM.

            We cannot easily fix that because the CSS OM API do not expect to create
            several rules in response to calls to the API.
            In this patch, I don't do anything fancy and just let the calls fail
            if we cannot use the rules safely.


            Content Extensions were also running into this problem. Large Selector lists are
            pretty common, and ContentExtensionStyleSheet::addDisplayNoneSelector() was
            overflowing the RuleData, creating broken page.

            Unlike CSSOM, there is no problem with splitting rules coming from Content Extensions.
            Instead of creating new APIs for that case, I rely on the parser to extend the StyleSheetContents.
            That code already knows how to break rules correctly.

            REGRESSION (r172417, r184065): Multiple rendering issues with fixed attached background-image
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147049

            The fixed-attached background-image rendering is special. In general, to
            display it, the destinationSize should be set to visibleContentSize. The
            destinationLocation should be set such that the background-image does
            not move with scrolling. The topContentInset should be subtracted from
            the destinationLocation such that background-image can be rendered blurred
            in the topContentArea. However there are cases in which these rules have to
            be changed.

            -- destinationSize: In the case of fixed layout size, the fixedLayoutSize
            is bigger than the visibleContentSize. In this case, if the background-image
            belongs to the root element, the destinationSize has to be set to fixedLayoutSize.
            Otherwise it has to be set to the borderBoxSize unless the overflow is
            hidden.

            -- destinationLocation: If the background-image belongs to the root element, no
            scroll offset to added to destinationLocation. For non-root element case,
            FrameView::documentScrollOffsetRelativeToViewOrigin() should be used if no page
            scaling is applied. Otherwise FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() should be
            used instead.

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
            issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
